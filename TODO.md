## Watch spesmilo/electrum#7459 before trusting the documented Electrum workaround

The published [wallet-connection guide](https://docs.start9.com/bitcoin-guides/connecting-wallets)
walks the user through dropping the device's root CA at `<datadir>/certs/<host>` so the
Electrum desktop wallet will connect. **That path is undocumented and works by accident**,
which is what makes it worth watching:
`_get_ssl_context` only reaches `is_server_ca_signed` when `_is_saved_ssl_cert_available()`
is False, and that check requires nothing more than a file that exists, parses as PEM/X509
and is in date — never that it is self-signed or matches the peer. The file then goes to
`create_default_context(cafile=...)` with `check_hostname = False`, so a root CA works as a
trust anchor and survives leaf rotation.

The underlying refusal is that a StartOS chain — `leaf ← StartOS Local Intermediate CA ←
<device> Local Root CA` — is OpenSSL verify code 19 (`self-signed certificate in certificate
chain`) against a public bundle, and `is_server_ca_signed` returns False only on code 18 and
re-raises everything else. Reproduced on Electrum 4.6.2 against both Fulcrum and electrs. Full analysis, and the
options offered upstream, are in
[spesmilo/electrum#7459](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/7459).

**Watch for a regression, not just a fix.** Nothing upstream guarantees the drop keeps
working: tightening `_is_saved_ssl_cert_available()` to require a self-signed or
peer-matching certificate would break the documented steps silently, with the wallet simply
refusing to connect again.

Revisit the docs when any of these lands:

- **Electrum documents the `certs/<host>` drop** — soften the guide's framing from
  "you place the certificate yourself" to a link at the upstream page.
- **A CA-import path ships** (config key or GUI file picker feeding `load_verify_locations`)
  — replace the manual steps with it.
- **Verify code 19 is treated like 18**, falling through to trust-on-first-use — the whole
  section goes away; Electrum then behaves like Sparrow and needs no setup at all.
- **The drop stops working** — the steps have to be replaced with whatever the new path is,
  urgently, because they will fail with no error naming TLS.

Touches when it changes:

- `start-technologies` → `projects/start-docs/bitcoin-guides/src/connecting-wallets.md` —
  the `## The Electrum desktop wallet` section and the trust-the-certificate list above it.
  That page is already published, so the change goes in as a PR against `live-docs`.
- `instructions.md` — the link to that page under `### Connecting a wallet`
- `README.md` — the one-sentence pointer in the interfaces section

electrs-startos carries the identical section and the same TODO; change both together.
